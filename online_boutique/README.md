**This application was forked from [microservices-demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo), used to demonstrate how to build micro servics with [dubbo-go](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-go).**

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 11-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)

### One-Command Setup

Start all services with a single command:

```bash
make start-all
```

This command will:
1. Build all 11 microservices
2. Start business services in the background
3. Wait for services to initialize
4. Start the load generator

### Access the Application

Once all services are running, you can access:
- **Web Frontend**: http://localhost:8090
- **Service Status**: Check with `make status`
- **Service Logs**: View with `make logs`

## ðŸ“‹ Makefile Commands

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile for easy service management:

### Basic Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make help` | Show all available commands |
| `make start-all` | Build and start all services |
| `make stop-all` | Stop all running services |
| `make status` | Check status of all services |
| `make logs` | View logs from all services |

### Service Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build-all` | Build all services without starting |
| `make clean-all` | Clean all build artifacts |
| `make tidy-all` | Run `go mod tidy` for all services |

### Individual Service Control

You can control individual services using the pattern `make <action>-<service>`:

```bash
# Build specific service
make build-adservice
make build-cartservice

# Start specific service
make start-adservice
make start-cartservice

# Stop specific service
make stop-adservice
make stop-cartservice
```

### Available Services

- `adservice` - Advertisement service
- `cartservice` - Shopping cart service
- `checkoutservice` - Checkout processing service
- `currencyservice` - Currency conversion service
- `emailservice` - Email notification service
- `frontendservice` - Web frontend service
- `paymentservice` - Payment processing service
- `productcatalogservice` - Product catalog service
- `recommendationservice` - Product recommendation service
- `shippingservice` - Shipping cost calculation service

### Environment Setup

Initialize your development environment:

```bash
# Check prerequisites and initialize project
make init

# Check environment dependencies
make check-env
```

### Service Monitoring

Monitor your services:

```bash
# Check which services are running
make status

# View recent logs from all services
make logs

# View logs for a specific service
tail -f logs/frontend.log
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check service status**: `make status`
2. **View logs**: `make logs`
3. **Restart services**: `make stop-all && make start-all`
4. **Clean build**: `make clean-all && make build-all`

### Development Workflow

For development, you might want to:

```bash
# Start only business services for development
make start-all

# Stop all services when done
make stop-all
```

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenTelemetry trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.
