**This application was forked from [microservices-demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo), used to demonstrate how to build micro servics with [dubbo-go](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-go).**

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 11-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenTelemetry trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.
